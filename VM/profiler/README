The 'profiler' is a program that generates basic block and control flow information based on address streams.
The following are various specs about the program.

1. Compile:
	g++ profiler.cpp -o profiler

2. Run:
	./profiler <Your directory/Your file>

3. Input: 
	a trace file generated by Valgrind tools (for reference, please see http://valgrind.org/) with the command line:
	valgrind --log-fd=1 --tool=lackey -v --trace-mem=yes   progname  > tracename.txt
	Please find the trace files used in the report in folder 'trace_file'.

4. Output:
	one '.block.txt' file containing basic block information in your current working directory.
	one '.flow.txt' file containing contorl flow information in your current working directory.

5. '.block.txt' file format:
	Each line has four columns corresponding to:
	Block_ID, Block starting address, The number of instructions in the block, The number of times the block is executed

6. '.flow.txt' file format:
	Each line has three columns corresponding to:
	Starting block ID, Ending block ID, The number of times the path is taken
	If a block has no outgoing edge, no flow entry will be displayed.

7. Example:
	Assume a 'abc.trace' file exists in the current working directory.
	Execute './profiler abc.trace'
	A 'abc.trace.block.txt' and a 'abc.trace.flow.txt' file will be generated.
